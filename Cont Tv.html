     <p> Lincoln Velazquez better known as Cong TV or just Cong (born: October 27, 1991 [age 28]) is a Filipino comedian, vlogger, streamer, and YouTuber and leader of the group Team Payaman as well as a member of Tier One. Starting out in 2008 making parodies and sketches, he is now a renowned vlogger in the Philippines. His style of comedy is noted for being a prime example of down-to-earth Filipino humour which a lot of his fans relate to.

He first grew to popularity making his Usapang... and Sampung utos series'. He now mostly does vlogs with his Team Payaman crew. Despite the brash personality that shows up in his videos he's a humble guy and helps out and supports his friends however and whenever he can.</p>
     <p>Cong created his account in February 2008 and made his first upload in December which was a parody of the music video for Silent Sanctuary's song, Rebound. He continued making short parodies and sketches, usually about whatever was popular in the Philippines. and took a short hiatus from 2009 and came back in 2011.

At that time he started his popular "Usapang..." and "Sampung utos" series' and also when his videos started to look more professional and better-edited. In 2015 he reached 100,000 subscribers and started vlogging through Cong Vlogs. Vlogging eventually became the main content on his channel which took up the majority of all his views and subscribers and in 2017, he reached 1,000,000 subscribers. His personality and humor has remained unchanged throughout his career and continues to do videos alongside Team Payaman.</p></center>
